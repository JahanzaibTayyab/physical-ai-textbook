# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body, teaching you how to apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Understand Physical AI principles** and embodied intelligence
2. **Master ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. **Simulate robots** with Gazebo and Unity
4. **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac** AI robot platform
5. **Design humanoid robots** for natural interactions
6. **Integrate GPT models** for conversational robotics

## Course Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Learn the middleware for robot control, including ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and how to bridge Python Agents to ROS controllers.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Master physics simulation and environment building, including sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs).

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Explore advanced perception and training with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Discover the convergence of LLMs and Robotics, including voice-to-action with OpenAI Whisper and cognitive planning.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

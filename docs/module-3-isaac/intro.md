# Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac

Welcome to Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain. In this module, you'll learn about NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for developing AI-powered robots with advanced perception, navigation, and control capabilities.

## What is NVIDIA Isaac?

NVIDIA Isaac is a robotics platform that combines:

- **Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS**: Hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages
- **Isaac GEMs**: Pre-built AI capabilities (perception, manipulation, navigation)
- **Isaac SDK**: Complete robotics development framework

## Why NVIDIA Isaac for Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots need:

- **Advanced perception**: Object detection, pose estimation, scene understanding
- **Real-time processing**: GPU-accelerated algorithms for low latency
- **Navigation**: Path planning for bipedal locomotion
- **Manipulation**: Grasping and manipulation planning
- **Learning**: Reinforcement learning for complex behaviors

Isaac provides all of this with GPU acceleration.

## Module Learning Outcomes
